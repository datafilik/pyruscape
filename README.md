# Pyruscape

Pyruscape is an electronic document dispatch management web application. It aims to simplify and facilitate official documentation management.

The movement of official documents between departments of an organisation is typical and cruicial activity and usually the documents are minuted on to indicating directives, approval, disapproval or other forms of reaction to the information in the recieved document, which is then sent to another department or back to the sender of the document. Usually the origiantor of the document would want to track the movement of the document to see if progress is being made. For this reason, records are kept of the departments and individuals in term who have received official documents and the current location of the document.

Pyruscape is a project aimed at digitizing and automating these functions. Let's bid the office file cabinet, goodbye.
